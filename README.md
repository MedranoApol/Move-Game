# NOTES : MOVE-GAME

I used the ucrt64 compilier for C++ acquired from msys64

The python script is to send the stats from the game to
a database. 

I used the Apache server for the database and database connection,
so you will need to create a database to send the stats to in order for
no errors to be run. 

More needs to be added
